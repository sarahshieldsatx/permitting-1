## Downtown Austin Alliance Strategic Efforts

The Downtown Austin Alliance 5-year strategic plan includes the goal of providing leadership, advocacy and direct funding to reduce the number of chronically homeless downtown by 25% by 2017. This is one goal among others related to improving public safety and addressing homelessness and social services-related issues.

The current one-year milestones for that goal include supporting:
* the development and implementation of a plan with the City’s Innovation Office and key stakeholders to improve safety around ARCH and more effectively move people into services, shelter and housing. 
* the City of Austin Neighborhood Housing & Community Development to issue an RFP by October 2016 to develop the city’s second, Housing First project with a minimum of 50-units. (This RFP was released in April. ATCIC’s Oak Springs 50-unit project is the first Housing First project in the city.)
*	approvals needed for development of Oak Springs Housing First project ground breaking by fall 2016.
*	approvals needed to begin phase II of Community First Village.
